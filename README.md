# AugustCompute

A decentralized compute platform for distributed model inference.

## Overview

AugustCompute enables decentralized model inference using distributed compute resources. The platform allows users to run models efficiently and affordably by leveraging a network of compute providers.

## Features

- **Decentralized Compute**: Leverage a network of distributed compute resources
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect your crypto wallet to interact with the platform
- **Cost Effective**: Pay only for the compute resources you use
- **Secure & Private**: End-to-end encryption for your data and models
